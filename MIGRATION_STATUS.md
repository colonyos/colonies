# Handler Migration Status

## âœ… Completed Migrations
- [x] Attribute handlers (2 endpoints)
- [x] User handlers (4 endpoints) 
- [x] Colony handlers (5 endpoints)
- [x] Executor handlers (7 endpoints)
- [x] Function handlers (3 endpoints)
- [x] Cron handlers (5 endpoints)
- [x] Generator handlers (6 endpoints)
- [x] Server handlers (2 endpoints)
- [x] Process graph handlers (6 endpoints)

**Total migrated: 40 endpoints** ðŸš€

## ðŸ”„ Remaining To Migrate 
- [ ] Process handlers (13 endpoints) - **Largest group**
- [ ] Log handlers (3 endpoints)
- [ ] File handlers (5 endpoints)
- [ ] Snapshot handlers (5 endpoints)
- [ ] Security handlers (4 endpoints)

**Total remaining: 30 endpoints**

## Summary
- **Original**: ~70 endpoint cases in switch statement
- **Migrated**: 40 endpoints to self-registration  
- **Remaining**: 30 endpoints in switch statement
- **Progress**: 57.1% migrated** ðŸŽ¯

## Benefits Achieved So Far
- Removed 26 case statements from the central switch
- 6 handler packages now self-register
- Significantly improved modularity and separation of concerns
- Registry system working smoothly with fallback support

## Next Steps
Since we've proven the pattern works well, the remaining handlers can be migrated following the same pattern. The process handlers will be the most complex due to their size (13 endpoints).
