# ColonyOS - Distributed Meta-Orchestrator

ColonyOS is an open-source framework for seamless execution of computational workloads across heterogeneous platforms - cloud, edge, HPC, IoT devices, and beyond. It creates **Compute Continuums** by providing a unified orchestration layer that operates as a meta-orchestrator on top of existing infrastructure.

## Why ColonyOS?

Traditional orchestration systems are tied to specific platforms (Kubernetes for cloud, Slurm for HPC, etc.). ColonyOS breaks these silos through **meta-process management** - a broker-based architecture that separates computational intent from execution.

Example of use cases:

- ** Scientific Computing**: Process satellite imagery, analyze sensor data, run simulations across HPC clusters
- ** AI/ML Pipelines**: Distribute training jobs, run inference on edge devices, orchestrate multi-agent LLM systems
- ** Serverless at Scale**: Build FaaS platforms that span cloud, edge, and on-premise infrastructure
- ** Data Processing**: ETL pipelines, batch processing, real-time stream processing with ColonyFS integration
- ** Industrial IoT**: Coordinate computations across factory floor devices, edge gateways, and cloud
- ** Earth Observation**: Automated satellite image processing and analysis workflows
- ** Infrastructure as Code**: Declaratively manage infrastructure across computing continuums - define resources spanning cloud, edge, HPC, and IoT with GitOps workflows, automatic drift detection, and self-healing reconciliation

### The Core Idea

**Declarative Intent + Broker + Distributed Execution = Computing Continuums**

Instead of writing platform-specific code, you declare **WHAT** you want to compute using Function Specifications. The Colonies Server acts as a **broker** that matches your intent with available **Executors** (distributed workers) that know **HOW** to execute on their specific platforms. This separation creates seamless **Computing Continuums** across heterogeneous infrastructure.

### Key Advantages

- ** Platform Agnostic**: Same function specification runs on Kubernetes, HPC, edge devices, IoT - executors translate to platform-specific execution
- ** Decoupled Architecture**: Submit work anytime, execute asynchronously - temporal and spatial decoupling via broker
- ** Zero-Trust by Design**: No session tokens, no passwords - every request cryptographically signed with Ed25519
- ** Protocol Flexibility**: Choose HTTP/REST, gRPC, CoAP (IoT), or LibP2P (P2P) - or run them all simultaneously
- ** Pull-Based Execution**: Executors connect from anywhere (even behind NAT/firewalls) and pull work - no need for inbound access
- ** Built-in Audit Trail**: Every execution recorded as an immutable ledger for compliance and debugging
- ** Real-Time Reactive**: WebSocket subscriptions for instant notifications on workflow state changes

## Key Features

- **Multi-Protocol Architecture**: Native support for HTTP/REST, gRPC, CoAP (IoT), and LibP2P (peer-to-peer)
- **Distributed Execution**: Executors run anywhere on the Internet - supercomputers, edge devices, browsers, embedded systems
- **Zero-Trust Security**: All communication cryptographically signed with Ed25519
- **Workflow DAGs**: Complex computational pipelines with parent-child dependencies
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time WebSocket subscriptions for process state changes
- **Scheduled Execution**: Cron-based and interval-based job scheduling
- **Dynamic Batching**: Generators that pack arguments and trigger workflows based on counter or timeout conditions
- **Resource Reconciliation**: Kubernetes-style declarative resource management with automatic drift detection and correction
- **Full Audit Trail**: Complete execution history stored as an immutable ledger
- **High Availability**: Etcd-based clustering with automatic failover
- **Multi-Language SDKs**: Go, Rust, Python, Julia, JavaScript, Haskell

## Architecture

### Core Concepts

- **Colony**: A distributed runtime environment - a network of loosely connected Executors
- **Executor**: Distributed worker that pulls and executes workloads (can be implemented in any language, runs anywhere)
- **Process**: Computational workload with states: WAITING → RUNNING → SUCCESS/FAILED
- **FunctionSpec**: Specification defining what computation to run and execution conditions
- **ProcessGraph**: Workflow represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- **Resource**: Declarative infrastructure specification with desired state management
- **Reconciliation**: Automatic drift detection and correction that maintains resources in their desired state

### How It Works

1. **Submit**: Users submit function specifications to the Colonies server
2. **Schedule**: The scheduler assigns processes to available Executors based on conditions
3. **Execute**: Executors pull assigned processes, execute them, and report results
4. **Chain**: Complex workflows span multiple platforms by chaining processes together
5. **Monitor**: Real-time subscriptions and full execution history enable observability

### Zero-Trust Security Model

Colonies implements a **zero-trust architecture** where all communication is cryptographically signed:
- No traditional authentication tokens or session management
- Each request signed with Ed25519 private keys
- Server validates signatures and enforces role-based access control
- Executors can operate on untrusted infrastructure while maintaining security

### Multi-Backend Support

Run Colonies server with any combination of protocols:

| Backend | Use Case | Port |
|---------|----------|------|
| **HTTP/REST** | Web APIs, dashboards, traditional clients | 8080 |
| **gRPC** | High-performance, low-latency communication | 50051 |
| **CoAP** | IoT devices, constrained environments | 5683 |
| **LibP2P** | Peer-to-peer, decentralized, NAT traversal | 4001 |

Configure via environment variable:
```bash
export COLONIES_SERVER_BACKENDS="http,grpc,libp2p"  # Run multiple protocols simultaneously
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start a Colonies Server

```bash
# Download configuration and docker-compose file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colonyos/colonies/main/docker-compose.env
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colonyos/colonies/main/docker-compose.yml

# Start the server (TimescaleDB + MinIO + Colonies Server + Docker Executor)
docker-compose up -d

# Load environment variables for CLI
source docker-compose.env
```

### 2. Install Colonies CLI

Download the CLI from [releases](https://github.com/colonyos/colonies/releases) (Linux/Mac/Windows):

```bash
sudo cp colonies /usr/local/bin
colonies --help
```

### 3. Submit and Execute a Function

```bash
# List available executors
colonies executor ls

# Submit a simple function
colonies function submit --spec examples/hello.json --follow

# The Docker executor will automatically pick it up and execute it
```

**What just happened?**
1. You submitted a function specification to the Colonies server
2. The scheduler assigned it to an available Docker executor
3. The executor pulled the task, executed it in a container, and reported results
4. All execution history is stored in the ledger for auditability
