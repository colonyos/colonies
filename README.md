# What is Colonies?
Colonies is a **Process Orchestration** framework for managing AI/ML workloads across heterogeneous computing platforms. 
* It provides a meta-layer where complex workflows can be described and managed as **meta-processes** independently on their implementation and where they are executed. 
* AI applications can then be broken down into composable functions executed by remote workers anywhere on the Internet, enabling a compute continuum spanning devices, cloud, edge, and HPC. 
* A build-in zero-trust protocol makes it possible to organize remote workers as a single unit called a **Colony**, thus making it possible for users to keep control even if workloads are spread out and executed on many different platforms at the same time.
